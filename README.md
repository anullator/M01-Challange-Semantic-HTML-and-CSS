# <M01 Challenge: Semantic HTML and CSS>

## Description

This project is the challenge assignment for Module 01 of the RICE Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. The objective was to transform non-semantic HTML into semantic, accessible HTML and to restructure the style.css file. During this project, I learned how to find the most specific semantic HTML element applicable and how to mitigate redundancy in a style.css file.
